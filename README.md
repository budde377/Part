# CB-Web common library
This library has the structure of a website in the CBCMS but should be used as a git submodule, thus not extended by the user.


## Requirements
The system installs some things on it own, but not all its requirements (yet).

You'll need the following software:

 * A lamb server with PHP 5
 * `dart-pub`
 * `php5-json`
 * `php5-imagick`
